            <p class="text-xl font-medium">
                In Javascript, Before ES6 programmers declared a variable with var keyword.
                The Scope of var is Global. If programmers declare a variable with var keyWord programmers can access this variable in whole window.This means that if programmers declared  any variable with var keyWord outside a function block it is available for use in the whole window.
                If programmers declared  a variable with var keyWord,the variable can be redeclared.In todays world there is no reason to use var.

            <p class="text-xl font-medium mb-5" >
                In Javascript ,After ES6 programmers declared a variable with let & const keyword.
                The Scope of let is blocked. If programmers declare a variable with let keyWord programmers can not be access this variable in whole window.let allows programmer to reassign.
                the let variable is a bounch of code bounded by curly bracket.If programmers declared  a variable with let keyWord,the variable can not be redeclared, but can be updated.
                 

            </p>

            <p class="text-xl font-medium">
                const keyword has some similarities with let keyword.If programmers declared  a variable with const keyWord,the variable can not be redeclared, and can not be updated.Const keyword maintaing the constant values.const allows programmer to re assign.

                It is a best practice that always declear a variable with const keyword.If we need to re assign a value then we use let keyword.

            <h1 class="text-4xl text-center bg-amber-300 my-5">Null</h1>
            <p class="text-xl font-medium">
                Null is a Primitive value in Javascript.Null means absence of value for a variable.The type of of Null is Object.
                .It is a falsy value.If there is no value in an Array and we want to set the value then we should use null.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-4xl text-center bg-amber-300 my-8">Undefined</h1>
            <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-medium">
                Undefined means a variable has been declared but has  not yet been assigned a value.The type of of Undefined is Undefined.It is a falsy value.
                There are some case when we get Undefined.<br>
                1.If we declare a variable that is not innitialized will give us Undefined.<br>
                2.If we declare a function and we do not return anything from the function will give us Undefined.<br>
                3.If we declare a function with some parameter and we do not give all parameter's valure will give us Undefined.<br>
                4.If we declare a function and it has no return nothing on the right side will give us Undefined.<br>
                5.If we declare a object with no property,or such as property which dosen't axist in the object will give us Undefined.<br>
                6.If we declare an Array and we want to access an element from the Array which dosen't exist in the Array will give us Undefined.<br>

            <p class="mb-12 text-xl font-medium">
